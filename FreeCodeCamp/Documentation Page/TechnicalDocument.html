          JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to
          provide programmatic control over them.
        </p>
        <p>
          JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes
          by supplementing it with additional objects; for example
        </p>
        <code>function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); } greetMe("World");</code>
        <ul>
          <li>Test</li>
          <li>Test</li>
